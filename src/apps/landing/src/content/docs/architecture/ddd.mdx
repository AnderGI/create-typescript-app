title: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
description: Architectural decisions based on DDD and their implementation in the template.
---

This project uses a DDD-inspired structure to guide the design of your software.

**Key elements included:**

- `contexts/`: Your business logic, organized by bounded contexts.
- `apps/`: The different entrypoints, like `backend` or `landing`, that use your domain logic.
- `libraries/`: Shared technical modules (e.g. logging, authentication, or messaging).
- Decoupled infrastructure with a clear dependency direction.

DDD encourages organizing code by business capability instead of technical layers. This structure enables better testing, evolution, and collaboration between teams.

> Use this section to document how to apply DDD principles within the project.
