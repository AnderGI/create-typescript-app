title: Add a New Use Case
description: Step-by-step guide to adding new functionality following the DDD structure.

To add a new use case in this template, follow these steps:

1. **Define the business logic**:
   - Create or update a module inside `src/contexts/<bounded-context>`.
   - Add the necessary domain entities, value objects, and services.

2. **Expose the use case**:
   - Add an application service or use case class that orchestrates the domain logic.

3. **Register the use case in the app**:
   - In `apps/<app-name>/dependency-injection/`, bind the use case.
   - Register your endpoint or trigger (e.g. an Express route or API handler).

4. **Test your use case**:
   - Add tests under `/tests/contexts` and possibly `/tests/apps`.

This structure ensures that your business logic remains independent of delivery concerns.
